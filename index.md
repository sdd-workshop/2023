As technology advances, software plays an ever-increasing role in our daily lives. Unsurprisingly, improving software quality is a central priority of our time. Approaches for understanding, diagnosing, localizing and fixing software defects are usually empirically grounded in datasets of software defects and their fixes. In recent years, a large number of defect datasets have been created, facilitating the evaluation of new techniques and enabling the study of software defects at a scale never seen before. Despite these advances, defect datasets face important challenges for their creation, maintainability and use. 

The SDD workshop aims at bringing together researchers and practitioners involved in the creation and use of defect datasets for software engineering research. The goal is to open discussion on best practices for creating defect datasets, current challenges faced by today's datasets and the needs of the software engineering community with regards to defect datasets. The workshop will feature contributed papers and invited talks in this area.

### <a class="anchor" name="topics">Workshop Topics</a>

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

* Design and development of defect datasets.
* Maintenance and evolution of defect datasets.
* Classification of defects in large datasets.
* Usability of defect datasets.
* Evaluation metrics for defect datasets.

----
### <a class="anchor" name="submissions"> Submissions and Format </a>

Authors are invited to submit manuscripts in English structured as
short papers at a length of at most 4 pages of content, excluding
references. Short papers can be (1) position papers that describe
issues related to the creation or use of defect datasets for software
engineering research, (2) experience papers that describe best
practices or challenges encountered when creating or using defects
datasets, or (3) extended abstracts that describe work in progress,
current challenges and/or opportunities in the area of defect
datasets. Submissions must conform to the [ESEC/FSE Format and Submission Guidelines](https://2023.esec-fse.org/track/fse-2023-research-papers). Papers not following
these guidelines will be rejected without review. At least one author
of an accepted paper must register for and attend the workshop.
